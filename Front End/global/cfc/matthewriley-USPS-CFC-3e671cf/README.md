# ColdFusion USPS CFC

This is a ColdFusion CFC used to connect to the USPS API. This has been tested with ColdFusion 9 and 10. 

## API's Supported:
 * CarrierPickupAvailability
 * CityStateLookup
 * ExpressMailCommitment
 * IntlRateV2
 * RateV4
 * TrackV2
 * Verify
 * ZipCodeLookup


In order for this CFC to work you need a [USPS API account](https://www.usps.com/business/webtools.htm) and you'll need to perform the tests required by the USPS to activate your account.

## Initialization

This is a straight forward CFC. You can initialize it using your preferred method. Here are a few examples. The named arguments are listed for clarity but you can also pass the values in by themselves.

**CreateObject()**

	variables.uspsUserID = 'YourIdHere';
	variables.usps = CreateObject('component', 'usps').init(isProduction=false, isSecure=false, uspsUserID=variables.uspsUserID);

**New Keyword**

	variables.uspsUserID = 'YourIdHere';
	variables.usps = New usps(isProduction=false, isSecure=false, uspsUserID=variables.uspsUserID);

**ColdSpring**

This assumes you're setting the properties elsewhere, otherwise you can set them as static strings.

	<bean id="usps" class="usps" singleton="true" lazy-init="true" autowire="no">
		<constructor-arg name="isProduction"><value>${isProduction}</value></constructor-arg>
		<constructor-arg name="isSecure"><value>${isSecure}</value></constructor-arg>
		<constructor-arg name="uspsUserID"><value>${uspsUserID}</value></constructor-arg>
	</bean>

## Sample Usage

Here's an example in cfscript:

	<cfscript>
	variables.uspsUserID = 'YourIdHere';
	variables.usps = New usps(false, false, variables.uspsUserID);
	
	// USPS Canned Test: This test cleanses an address and provides the ZIP+4 value.
	variables.Verify1 = variables.usps.AddressValidate(
		Address2 = '6406 Ivy Lane',
		City = 'Greenbelt',
		State = 'MD'
	);
	
	// USPS Canned Test: This test will also cleanse the address and completes the ZIP Code.
	variables.Verify2 = variables.usps.AddressValidate(
		Address2 = '6406 IVY LN',
		City = 'GREENBELT',
		State = 'MD',
		Zip5 = '20770',
		Zip4 = '1440'
	);
	</cfscript>

## Files Included

**usps.cfc**

This is where the magic happens.

**USPSCannedTests.cfm**

The [USPS Development Guide](https://www.usps.com/business/webtools-technical-guides.htm) includes a number of canned tests. This file has them preconfigured and ready to go. Plug in your USPS user ID and run it.

**ManualTester.html**

This is a plain HTML file with a form to post directly to the USPS Test API. Useful for debugging the XML outside of ColdFusion.

## Pull Requests

I don't have all the USPS API's implemented so if there's one you'd like to add, feel free to do so with a pull request. Just be sure to follow the general method pattern for a consistent implementation.
