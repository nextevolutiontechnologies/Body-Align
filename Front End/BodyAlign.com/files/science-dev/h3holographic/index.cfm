<h3>H3 Holographic Technology</h3>
<p align=justify>Body Align bases its technology on light, sound, longitudinal scalar waves and vortex physics as the basic principles behind biological processes and equipment.</p>
<p align=justify>Body Align uses longitudinal scalar waves (LSW), or Meyl Waves, as the imprinting process. The theory of LSW wave forms was practically developed over 100 years ago by Nikola Tesla, a Serbian-born and later naturalized American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.  German Professor Konstantin Meyl reintroduced to his students in the 90's to LSW after he had done years of research on Tesla patents.</p> 
<p align=justify>According the Dr. Meyl, LSW waves have the ability to propagate faster than the speed of light, violate the square of the distance law in physics, and create conditions of over unity in regards to more power being generated from the receiver than has been transmitted by the transmitter. Frankly, this is something that most physicists would think is crazy, but the experimental results seem to show that it is true.</p>	
<p align=justify>Dr. Meyl also postulates that LSW is the primary communication vehicle for DNA. That means that using DNA for biological signal programming produces the highest quality results.</p>
