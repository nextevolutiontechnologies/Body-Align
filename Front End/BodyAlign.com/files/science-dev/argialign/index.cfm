<h4>About Argi Align</h4>
<p align=justify>The most important question you need to ask yourself is: Why is this formula that important? Well, the answer is simple. Your body has about six quarts of blood. This blood circulates throughout the body six times a minute and your blood flows over 12,000 miles a day. That is four times across the USA daily and what's even more amazing, your heart beats 35 million times a year and that equates to over twenty five Billion times in your lifetime. </p>
<p align=justify>The human heart pump produces the equivalent of one million barrels of blood in its lifetime, enough to fill up over forty five thousand shipping containers, all this while never taking a break. Ultimately all of this equates to a heart that works, very, very hard. Twice as hard as the human leg muscles as they are performing an all out sprint and this is while the heart is functioning at rest.</p>
<p align=justify>The healthy nutrition science solution for your heart health and overall cardio functional care is the science of Argi Align.</p>
<p align=justify>The reason is that over twenty million people in the United States alone and over one hundred million people worldwide are affected in some way big and small with a cardio issue. In the United States alone over five hundred thousand people a year are newly affected by some form of cardio issue and the statistics are trending in a larger direction each and every year regardless of the awareness campaigns.  These statistics are incredible, however, so is our healthy solution, Argi Align!</p>
<p align=justify>The basic science of Argi Align is purely based on a Noble Prize winning medical breakthrough that some consider to be one of the most important advancements in the fight to naturally lower blood pressure, high cholesterol and increase sexual function in adults in the last twenty years. It is known that many people are most likely deficient in a very important molecule known as nitric oxide. Incredibly by simply taking enough of the combination of  L-Arginine and </p>
<p align=justify>L-Citrulline that is within our proprietary formula of Argi Align, it is possible to decrease this inefficiency and bring back natures healthy nitric oxide resource and response.</p>
<p align=justify>Argi Align is the most potent, efficient bioavailable L Arginine based product available in the wellness market today. Optimum absorption and utilization of high quality nutrients is the key to a safe and effective dietary supplement.</p>
<p align=justify>Argi Align is a proprietary blend set far and away apart from all of the other products on the market today.</p>
<p align=justify>Argi Align utilizes an advanced form of L Arginine called AAKG (Alpha Ketogluterate). Our product is a one hundred percent blend, pharmaceutical grade L Arginine and Alpha Ketogluerate.  You receive all of the targeted nitric oxide support of L Arginine plus a number of benefits from AAKG (Alpha Ketogluterate). Those include more L Arginine stability, bioavailability and absorption.</p>
<p align=justify>This is the one true cardio support product that is fast becoming a staple in a humans overall lifetime functional wellness plan.</p>
