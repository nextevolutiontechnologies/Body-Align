<h3><strong>What is arginext?</strong></h3>
<p>arginext is a doctor formulated product, in the form of a delicious  powdered drink mix, designed to help promote optimal cardiovascular  health. Its active ingredient is arginine, a semi-essential amino acid  that has been scientifically proven to improve vascular health. The  arginine in arginext is delivered in a low-fat mix of other  heart-healthy ingredients, including Reveratrol, Vitamin D3, VitaminK2  and essential amino acids.</p>

<h3><strong>How does arginext work?</strong></h3>
<p>The active ingredient in arginext products is arginine AAKG, an amino  acid used by the human body to produce nitric oxide (NO), which helps  blood vessels maintain their elasticity so blood can flow efficiently to  the heart.</p>
<p>In people with or at risk of developing heart disease, NO production  is reduced because arginine is converted less efficiently to NO; to  maintain a healthy level of NO, extra arginine is needed by the body.  arginext may help to improve NO production by supplementing the body  with the extra arginine needed. The most common source of arginine in  the US is red meat, which is not a desirable source for consumption by  persons with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>arginext products are specifically designed for daily consumption by  providing the extra arginine the body needs, without added calories or  cholesterol.</p>
<p>It has been clinically proven that oral arginine supplementation can  improve endothelial function and endogenous production of nitric oxide.  In selected patients, it has been shown to improve blood flow, increase  treadmill exercise performance and reduce some fatigue.</p>
<p><a id="d"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>What foods would I have to eat to get the arginine I'd get from arginext?</strong></h3>
<p>Soy, fish, nuts and some legumes are all good sources of arginine.  Unfortunately, the majority of Americans get their arginine from red  meats, which is not a desirable source of arginine. To get the amount of  arginine you get in one arginext you'd need to eat a substantial amount  of red meat or shell fish.</p>
<p><a id="e"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>Can&rsquo;t I just take arginine capsules?</strong></h3>
<p>Certainly you can — but to get the same amount of arginine AKG you  get in one arginext you'd need to swallow twelve (12) capsules every  day. Most people simply don't want to swallow that many capsules — and  won't, not long-term. Patients report that when they use arginext as  part of their daily regimen, they see "high compliance." This is  doctors' language for saying, people actually keep drinking the drink  mix every day!</p>
<p>What's more, in arginext you are getting your arginine in a powerful  mix of many other heart-healthy ingredients, including essential amino  acids, vitamins and minerals.</p>

<h3><strong>What is arginine?</strong></h3>
<p>Arginine is an semi- essential amino acid (a building block of  protein). "Essential" means that our body cannot manufacture it: we must  take it through our diet. Arginine plays a vital role in the  manufacture of nitric oxide (NO), which is crucial to vascular health.</p>
<p><a id="g"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>What is nitric oxide?</strong></h3>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator, which means that it helps  to keep your blood vessels open, enabling good blood flow. The Nobel  Price for Medicine was awarded in 1998 to three doctors for their  discoveries of the role of nitric oxide.</p>
<p><a id="h"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>Is arginext mainly intended for people with cardiovascular disease?</strong></h3>
<p>No, not "mainly" and certainly not "exclusively." Everybody needs  good, healthy blood flow throughout bodies, and everybody wants to live  their lives with full energy, vitality and wellbeing!</p>
<p><a id="i"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>What are &ldquo;vascular conditions&rdquo; and whom do they affect?</strong></h3>
<p>The most well-known vascular condition, of course, is coronary artery  disease: heart problems. Cardiovascular disease is our nation's number  one cause of death; in fact, it kills more people than the next nine  leading causes of death combined!</p>
<p>However, there are many other, perhaps less well-known vascular  problems. Erectile dysfunction and other forms of compromised sexual  function may be vascular in nature. People with diabetes commonly suffer  from a range of vascular problems, which can impair eyesight,  circulation to the kidneys, limbs and other symptoms as well as heart  disease. Stroke, angina, and Reyes Syndrome are other examples of  vascular conditions. One in four American adults has high blood pressure  (American Heart Association, 1999) — only one of six risk factors  identified by the American Heart Association.</p>
<p><a id="j"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>How do I know if I am &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for cardiovascular problems?</strong></h3>
<p>The American Heart Association has identified six factors that may indicate a greater risk of developing heart disease:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have diabetes…</li>
  <li>If you smoke (or have smoked in the past)…</li>
  <li>If you have high blood pressure…</li>
  <li>If you have high cholesterol…</li>
  <li>If you are seriously overweight (which includes six out of every ten people in the United States)…</li>
  <li>If anyone in your family has a history of heart disease…</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Patients should not undertake any type of self-diagnoses or  self-treatment without the active supervision of a physician. If you  have any medical questions, we recommend you consult your physician.</p>
<p><a id="k"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>Is arginext a replacement for existing medical approaches to treating coronary artery and vascular disease?</strong></h3>
<p>No. Physicians have used arginext as a valuable part in their overall  strategy for the dietary management of vascular conditions. However, it  is not intended to replace or supplant existing medical approaches to  therapy. Those interested in using arginext to help improve an existing  cardiovascular condition should consult their physician.</p>
<p><a id="l"> </a></p>
<h3><strong>Does arginext cause weight gain or have adverse metabolic effects?</strong></h3>
<p>In clinical studies, patients who consumed arginexts that contained a  total of 8 grams of arginine daily did not experience weight gain.  arginext in a small clinical study reduced total and LDL cholesterol.</p>
