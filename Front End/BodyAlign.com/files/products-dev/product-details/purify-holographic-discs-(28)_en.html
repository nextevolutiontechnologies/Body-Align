<strong>Recharge, Rejuvenate And Renew</strong>
<p>The Purify Disc lets you cleanse yourself from a lifetime of toxic foods, bad habits and pollutants in the environment. It's helps dislodge those negative substances from the organs they have become stored in. Combined with drinking pure water, it coaxes the body to flush out impurities. That gives the body the chance to actually eliminate the toxins instead of storing them somewhere else. Benefits associated with detoxification include increased energy, better blood circulation, a stronger immune system, clearer skin, improved digestion, reduced aches and pains, weight management, a stronger libido and many more.

<br/>
If you want to feel better overall by getting rid of toxic chemical your body has stored, the Purify Disc is the easiest way you can do it.</p>

I began using the Purify disc as a matter of testing all of the Body Align products. First, I used it on my foot, then the other foot. Interestingly, it seemed to help with the discomfort that had been in my legs. I am so thrilled with the results so far and I have tremendous hope for the future. Heartily, I say "thank you" to Steve and Warren and all the folks at Body Align for this disc that we call PURIFY.

First let me say that I’m a nurse. In 2011 I was run over by a car. I have multiple injuries and have lived in pain every day. When I got my kit and put the bracelet on, within an hour, I realized that my back didn’t hurt! Um! Well, if that will make this big a difference, let me try something else… I am a researcher, so I saw the purify disc has an analgesia quality. So I put a purify disc on the recommended spot. For the first time since November 2011, my foot did not hurt! Not only did it not hurt, I had range of motion, that doesn’t just happen! I can honestly say, Thank you Body Align! I can’t believe that after one and a half years of pain, something so spectacular has happened that I don’t swallow pain pills by the first full anymore. It is an amazing thing!

I had the experience of going to the hospital in July of this summer and was admitted to ICU for pneumonia and septic shock. About four weeks later I started to feel a cold coming and heading into my lungs, as soon as I felt that I took my purify disks and put them in the LU-1 position along the collar bone, I noticed within a very short time my lungs were clearing and I was breathing better the cold stayed out of my lungs! I am so grateful, I am prone to bronchitis as well, in using the purify discs and through the support and education of my sponsors and the BA family I did not even get sick. I saved $100.00 for a doctor’s visit (at a minimum) the cost of antibiotics and most importantly the cost of time not spent with family and life! Thank you Body Align!
