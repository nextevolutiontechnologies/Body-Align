 <p>ArgiAlign™ is based  on a Nobel Prize winning medical breakthrough that some consider to be one of  the most important advancements in the fight to naturally lower High Blood  Pressure, Stroke, High Cholesterol, Heart Attack, and Sex Drive Loss.<br>
  <br>
  ArgiAlign™ is the  most potent, efficient and bioavailable L-arginine based product on the market  today. Optimum Absorption and utilization of high quality nutrients is the key  to a safe and effective Dietary Supplement. &quot;You Are What You Eat, Digest  and Absorb&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  ArgiAlign™ contains  a Proprietary Blend of 6 Amino Acids featuring the Positive Charged R Group of  (L-Arginine, L-Lysine, L-Histidine) along with L-Citrulline, L-Taurine,  L-Proline along with AstraGin™ that is included for enhanced absorption of both  L-arginine and L-citrulline. This proprietary blend sets ArgiAlign™ apart from  all other L-arginine and Nitric Oxide supplements on the market today.<br>
  <br>
  ArgiAlign™ enhanced  with AstraGin™ completely eliminates the absorption problem of L-arginine. AAKG  utilizes a different enzymatic pathway than regular L-Arginine, which ALLOWS  OUR BODY TO ABSORB OVER 90% OF THE AAKG THAT WE CONSUME. In addition to  doubling the absorption rate, AAKG INCREASES BLOOD FLOW 200-300% MORE  EFFICIENTLY THAN REGULAR L-ARGININE.<br>
  <br>
ArgiAlign™ uses an  advanced form of L-arginine called AAKG (L-arginine Alpha-Ketoglurate ). AAKG  is a 100% blend of pharmaceutical grade L-arginine and Alpha-Ketoglutrate. You  get all the endothelial-lining-support and vasodilation properties of arginine  plus a number benefits from alpha ketoglutarate (AKG), such as more arginine  stability, bioavailability and absorption. Furthermore, alpha ketoglutarate  will serve as a transport medium for arginine, making it directly available at  the cellular levels for optimal synthesis. Beyond this, alpha ketoglutarate  improves the endogenous production of glutamine and glutamic acid, both  important for muscle growth and for the immune system. AKG also binds to toxic  ammonia in muscle cells, in the liver, and in the brain, thereby converting  ammonia into glutamic acid improving glutamine levels and assisting in  elimination of toxic ammonia from the body. Lastly, as a Krebs Cycle  intermediate, AKG improves VO2 Max and energy metabolism in muscle cells, and  is consequently a potent ergogenic.</p>

<p> "After years of taking many L-arginine products and spending upwards of $200 per month. I have been taking the ArgiAlign product and am happy that I have improved results and enjoy the taste. I am only using 1 scoop a day versus several a day with the others. With what I am saving I now have my wife, mother and other family members taking a scoop every day. Brilliant product and recommend it." - John K - London, England

"When I discovered ArgiAlign, I was impressed not only with the science behind the product, but the years of hands on research that have gone in to the formulation. I am a recent convert, and I love the results and have more energy for my morning trail runs." - D. Tanner, 78-year-old Triathlete & Author; San Carlos CA </p>
