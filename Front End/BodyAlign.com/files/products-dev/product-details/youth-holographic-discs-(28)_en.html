<strong>Slow Down The Effects Of Aging</strong>

It can help you look better and feel better and reduce many of the symptoms associated with hormone imbalances.

For many years I would often awake with 'night sweats' about 4am. Now, with BA Youth discs, I no longer have this unpleasant experience. I wear them according to the rotation schedule on the BA Youth brochure, three days on, one day off. I am also noticing enhanced mental clarity without the occassional 'fog brain' feeling and a more youthful facial skin appearance. Thank you Body Align!!

Before she shared using the disc she was having a lot of hot flashes and mood swings and a mental clarity wasn’t that good. Afterwards, actually 20 minutes afterwards I could start to tell the difference in how she felt. She’s using the 3 on and 1 off and has very limited hot flashes and aren’t nearly as severe as before. Memory and thinking is clearer. Mood swings are gone. As soon as she started using it she could tell a really big difference. She has had breast cancer and can’t have hormonal replacement therapy her oncologist weren’t able to give me HRT’s because they increase the chances of breast cancer. Under no condition would they give her HRT. She was on homeopathic medication and it increased her heart rate that she had to stop. Went back to the doctor and she asked what was on her throat? Told her it had natural compounds. No increased heart rate and no side effects. Blood work was good and keep right on using them. Medical Administrator so I’ve seen it all…

I joined the Body Align family in August and since that time, I have been wearing the youth disc. From the moment I began wearing it, I could see and feel the difference in the way that my skin looked. Immediately, I could see a brightness in my face. I can see a glow that I haven't seen in a long. After I had worn it for about a week, my friend looked at me, and said, "What did you do to your face, you look different." Here is a photo that I took showing a comparison of me when I was 23 years old, and how I look today. As you can see, I am wearing my wristband as well as one of my discs. In the morning when I awake, I feel great, ready to get up, and start my day. Love what's happening at the company, and where it's going. Thank you for being there for us, and helping us to feel a part of the family. With great expectation,
