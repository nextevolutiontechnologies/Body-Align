<h3><img border="0" align="right" alt="Brain Bright" src="http://www.bodyalign.com/files/img/products/ultimate-wellness-band2.png" width="180">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;How many bottles should I order?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that our brains are constantly being exposed to various environmental brain toxins in our air, water, and food supply (not to mention unavoidable electromagnetic radiation from WIFI and cell phone signals) we truly believe that EVERYONE should be supporting their brain health, ongoing, every single day with the premium brain-boosting ingredients exclusively found in BioTrust Brain Bright. </p>
<p> With that said, it is best to stock up and save more today with our special three- and six-bottle discounted packages.&nbsp; You can always return what you don't use if you decide Brain Bright isn't right for you. Additionally, these packages allow you to take advantage of our lowest possible prices today, without the worry of increasing prices and/or additional shipping fees later.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the ingredients and amounts used in the formula?</strong></p>
<p><img width="460" border="0" alt="Argi align Cardio Supplement Facts" src="http://www.bodyalign.com/files/img/products/argi-align-nutrition-label.png"></p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What specifically makes Brain Bright the best supplement of its kind?</strong></p>
<p>That's a great question. Simply put, unlike inferior competing products that only attempt to address one part of the brain, Brain Bright offers you <strong>triple-action brain enhancement </strong>with three unique approaches to brighten a drained brain: enhancing neurotransmitter levels, increasing blood flow, and supporting the protection of the brain from cortisol, toxins and oxidative damage (which is like “rusting” of the brain).</p>
<p>In the end, the research-backed ingredients representing Brain Bright's 3 unique pathways translate to 3 incredible benefits for you: </p>
<ol>
<li>Greatly Improved Memory and Recall</li>
<li>Immediate Concentration and Razor-Sharp Focus, and…</li>
<li>Second-to-None Long-Term Brain Health (shielding you from the many toxins we mentioned previously) each and every day you continue to use Brain Bright.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to mention significant improvements in learning, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking skills. </p>
<p> Beyond that, the unfortunate reality is that most supplements today are not founded on science and backed by research (Brain Bright is).&nbsp; Further, most companies do not test their products to ensure that what's on the label is actually in the bottle (BioTrust does).&nbsp; Even worse, some companies are known to flat out lie on their labels and fill their products with nothing more than rice flour and other fillers.</p>
<p> Another common pitfall of dietary supplements is dramatically underdosed formulas that do not deliver effective levels of each ingredient.&nbsp; Clearly, if science shows 200mg of an ingredient to be effective, putting 20mg of the ingredient in the product for “window dressing” isn't going to do anything for your results.&nbsp; This deceptive practice saves the manufacturer money, but robs you of the results you deserve.</p>
<p> All that said, you can rest assured that when you invest in Brain Bright you are getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quality, science-backed formula based on peer-reviewed research, containing honest, effective levels of each ingredient<strong></strong></li>
<li>A quality product that has been verified as pure and potent through 3rd-party testing<strong></strong></li>
<li>A quality product that is manufactured in a certified GMP facility<strong></strong></li>
<li>A customer care team that is committed to your success<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, at BioTrust we are committed to doing EVERYTHING the right way, with integrity, and with your results in mind… and that's exactly why you can be confident in joining the BioTrust team today, and experiencing the science behind what Brain Bright has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What is the best way to take this product?</strong></p>
<p>Simply take one (1) tablet, two times daily before meals, and let the research behind Brain Bright do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;Does this product contain caffeine or any other stimulants?</strong></p>
<p>No. This product is caffeine- and stimulant-free.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;Are there any allergy concerns with this product?</strong></p>
<p>Like every BioTrust product, Brain Bright is made with natural ingredients and completely free of gluten, dairy, wheat, soy, egg, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts. It also contains NO sugar and NO artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors or preservatives. Brain Bright is 100% gluten-free and contains no GMO ingredients.&nbsp; If you have any concerns you should consult your physicians before taking any supplement.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;If I have a medical condition, can I take this product?</strong></p>
<p>Brain Bright is made with natural ingredients and is considered safe and extremely effective for nearly everyone. However, if you take prescription medications or have a medical condition, we recommend that you show a bottle of Brain Bright to your physician and/or pharmacist for proper approval. You can always return it later with our 1-YEAR Money Back Guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;How will this product be shipped to me and how quickly? </strong></p>
<p>We will ship your order directly to your home or office using a premium carrier such as FedEx or UPS, and customers in the US can expect their orders within 5 to 7 business days. International orders typically take 8 &ndash; 15 business days (plus customs clearance time). Rush shipping is available.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;Will anything else be sent to me, or billed to me, after I order?</strong></p>
<p>No. This is NOT an auto-ship program. You only get shipped what you order today and nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;Is it safe to order online from your web site?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We use a 256-bit secure ordering server so you are protected the same as if you were ordering from Amazon.com or any other trusted Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;How long will today's special pricing be available?</strong> </p>
<p>We are unable to guarantee today's pricing beyond today. Our pricing often changes due to the constantly changing prices of the high-quality, exotic ingredients used in Brain Bright as well as supply and demand. To guarantee our lowest pricing, be sure to secure your order today.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What if this product doesn't work for me? </strong></p>
<p>While Brain Bright was created to work and is based on extensive amounts of peer-reviewed research, if for any reason at all you are unsatisfied with your Brain Bright purchase, just let us know and we will issue a prompt and courteous refund even on empty bottles. You're always protected by our industry best 1-YEAR 100% Money Back Guarantee. </p>

<p>“As a Nutrition Specialist, I'm extremely picky about which supplements I recommend to my clients.

				    		 <p>The energy band really works!!! I get up 6 days a week at around 4:25 am to exercise. This consists of a 5 1/2 to 6 mile walk. How do I know it works? My walking route has some hills along the way at about a 30 to 35 degree incline. Prior to wearing the Ultimate Health Band, my breathing would be labored. After wearing the band for a couple of days, I’ve started to run the hill without any difficulty; my breathing remains normal. My walking partners are very inquisitive and they want to know which medications I've begun taking. I did NOT tell them I was wearing the Ultimate Health Band. Later, after I shared my secret with them, one joined the business and the other is pending. It really works!!! If you want the energy you have been missing, wear the band. I have to tell the Mark Thomas story - Mark came to Killeen from Arkansas, making a couple of stops along the way to present the business opportunity. After a 20 hour workday, he arrived at my home at about 1:45 am. With a couple hours of sleep, I invited him to go with me to exercise; he reluctantly accepted. We were up and on our way at 4:25 am. I did not cut him any slack. I walked my same route - 5 1/2 to 6 miles. What was most impressive to me; his breathing pattern did not change. I know Mark had not done any type of physical training since Oct of last year. He was a Marine. I guess what he reiterates often is true--once a Marine always a Marine. He was and has been wearing the Ultimate Health Band. It really works!

				   <p>I received my Chiropractic license in 1967 and Acupuncture certification in 1974 and practiced using both until 1995 and I have treated my wife since 1969. We have been married over 20 of those years. She has needed treatment almost daily for those 20 years for either headache, neck pain, back pain or leg pain and has had really bad headaches for too many years to try and pin down how long. She has been wearing the arm band now for about 4 weeks. During that time, I have noticed that she no longer has the headaches, she doesn't need her neck, back or legs fixed. Just this morning we discussed the fact that our life has changed a great deal, because we not only feel better in general, but our general sense of "wellbeing" is much improved.
