<h4>Testing Effects On Red Blood Cells And The Bodies Circulatory System Using 8ight Relief Holographic Discs.- HealthWalk</h4>
<p align=justify>Comparison of before and after tests of the Relief Disc from 8ight exhibited a marked decrease in blood flow viscosity, which is consistent with improved metabolic parameters normally seen in blood with the proper Zeta potential. The blood cells reflected increased separation, spin and vibration rate within 2 minutes of applying the Relief Holographic Disc. </p>

<h4>Testing The Effects Of The 8ight Relief Holographic Disc On Pain Areas Using Thermal Imaging. - HealthWalk</h4>
<p align=justify>Comparison of before and after tests of the Relief Disc from 8ight exhibited a cooling effect on the pain area and the cooling effect appeared to transmit to other areas of the body. This cooling effect of inflammation from athletic exercise could lead to increased muscle endurance from the reduction in inflammation and pain. </p>

<h4>Demonstrating A Significant Influence In Biofield Resonance, Bionetic Harmonics, And Bioelectrical Zeta Potential - Lee G. Wooley</h4>
<p align=justify>This paper provides a scientific basis regarding the significant and on-going demonstrations of positive interactions with the biofield (Rubik 2002), bionetic harmonics (Woolley 1994) and bioelectrical zeta potential responses through the use of the 8ight programmed holographic discs when placed in close proximity to, or onto the skin of the human body. </p>

<h4>Biocoherence - 8ight</h4>
<p align=justify>When a Data Disc&#8482; is in the body's biofield they act to bring the body into biocoherence and balance, 100% of the time. We have conducted numerous tests to confirm this. These results are now being formulated into a detailed study
We are authenticating and replicating, in the lab, that the feedback we are getting from the field and the lab are the same. The Lab results confirm that 100% of the time the Data Discs&#8482; are influencing the acupuncture system of the body. </p>
