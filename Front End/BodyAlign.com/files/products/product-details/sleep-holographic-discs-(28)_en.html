Two hours after getting my ultimate wristband and putting it on; I felt a surge of energy, like a runner's high when I was jogging. That evening I slept for hours 7 by using the sleep discs. I woke up once for my 'pit stop' at 3am in the morning but I went back to sleep within 20 minutes instead of an hour or two.

I wanted to take the time out to say thank you to everyone at Body Align. Along with many people who are getting older, I have had problems sleeping. I wake up, go to the bathroom and can't go back to sleep right away. I used to be up for 1 Â½ hours after this nightly ritual before I started using the Sleep disc. I just put them on the inside of my wrist and sleep like a baby now. Thank you Body Align!

I want to say the sleep disc works amazing. I was on sleeping pills for years. I had to get off them, but I still was not sleeping well. It got so bad that my doctor put me on an anti-depressant. Once the Sleep discs kicked in, I was able to be 100% drug free!
