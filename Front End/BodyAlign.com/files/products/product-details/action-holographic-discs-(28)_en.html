 He has been having a serious case of vertigo (dizziness) and a peripheral vision issue for an unknown reason for the past several years. He has visited his physician and specialists for (at least) the past 2 years and they have been unable to do anything, or give us a definitive reason for this. My dad is a very young, early 70â€™s gentleman that had given up hope of being able to drive.

He started using the action disc for sustained energy and he was able to (for the first time in a very long time) turn himself around several times (think twirl) in his living room last week without a bit of vertigo.

This is a man that had given up hope and was starting to (for the first time in my 50 years) feel deflated and old. I would say he was bordering on clinical depression because of the things he was no longer able to do and BA has given him back his hope and youthful attitude. I got my Daddy back!
