<strong>Your favorite pets can have the same physical challenges you do. They're part of the family and nothing can be more heartbreaking than seeing the animal you love lethargic or in pain.</strong>
<p>To make matters worse, they can't tell you how badly they feel, but you can see it in every movement they make.
<br/>
<br/>
But there's good news! Your pets can benefit from BodyAlign H3 technology just like the rest of your family.
<br/>
<br/>
The Pet Tag brings the combined benefits of the BodyAlign Action Disc, Relief Disc, and Purify Disc directly to your petsâ€¦ just at a lower strength. When you attach a Pet Tag to your pet's collar, you'll be surprised how quickly you see bounce and vitality returning to your favorite friend.</p>

I want to let you know how well one of the Relief Holographic Discs has worked for my dog. She had radical surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from her neck a year ago and has had remnant periodic pain from the extreme nature of the surgery. This fall when she was going through a particularly long spell of pain, I applied a Relief Holographic disc to one of her dog tags to see if it could impact the pain level for her and was amazed that within a half hour she was feeling better. The pain spell had lasted for almost two months, so that kind of response was amazing to see. I've kept one on her dog tag ever since. Thanks

While I was visiting my niece I noticed her dog had a skin condition that was driving her crazy with itch (I had just signed up with BA but didn't have my kit yet ) She had her discs so we put a Relief Disc on the collar and secured it with tape. It was not but a few minutes when the dog was lying down comfortable and asleep . Do I believe in the miracle of BA? I sure do !! Dogs don't know about the "Placebo effect"!! This is for real !!

Prissy had been having seizures and was on anti-seizure meds which came with negative side-effects. She began wearing her Pet Power Tag about three weeks. She was immediately able to come off the anti-seizure meds that she was taking daily. She has remained seizure-free and has had lots of energy. Her appetite is hearty. She is back to my sweet Prissy! My little teacup Chihuahua feels great! Thank you so much for introducing me to this phenomenal Pet Tag, it really works! Very happy,

Just a quick update. I took Buddy for his first walk yesterday, 1 1/2 weeks after getting the tag on him. He amazed me....stepping out more strongly and securely....not wobbling or stumbling at all. We had a really good time and stayed out a full hour !! He was alert and interested and showing me where HE wanted to go! Wishful thinking or not.....Buddy is definitely doing better and acting younger than he has in recent memory! Thanks for helping him! Have a great week!
