 The energy band really works!!! I get up 6 days a week at around 4:25 am to exercise. This consists of a 5 ½ to 6 mile walk. How do I know it works? My walking route has some hills along the way at about a 30 to 35 degree incline. Prior to wearing the Ultimate Health Band, my breathing would be labored. After wearing the band for a couple of days, I’ve started to run the hill without any difficulty; my breathing remains normal. My walking partners are very inquisitive and they want to know which medications I’ve begun taking. I did NOT tell them I was wearing the Ultimate Health Band. Later, after I shared my secret with them, one joined the business and the other is pending. It really works!!! If you want the energy you have been missing, wear the band. I have to tell the Mark Thomas story - Mark came to Killeen from Arkansas, making a couple of stops along the way to present the business opportunity. After a 20 hour workday, he arrived at my home at about 1:45 am. With a couple hours of sleep, I invited him to go with me to exercise; he reluctantly accepted. We were up and on our way at 4:25 am. I did not cut him any slack. I walked my same route- 5 ½ to 6 miles. What was most impressive to me; his breathing pattern did not change. I know Mark had not done any type of physical training since Oct of last year. He was a Marine. I guess what he reiterates often is true--once a Marine always a Marine. He was and has been wearing the Ultimate Health Band. It really works!

I received my Chiropractic license in 1967 and Acupuncture certification in 1974 and practiced using both until 1995 and I have treated my wife since 1969. We have been married over 20 of those years. She has needed treatment almost daily for those 20 years for either headache, neck pain, back pain or leg pain and has had really bad headaches for too many years to try and pin down how long. She has been wearing the arm band now for about 4 weeks. During that time, I have noticed that she no longer has the headaches, she doesn't need her neck, back or legs fixed. Just this morning we discussed the fact that our life has changed a great deal, because we not only feel better in general, but our general sense of "wellbeing" is much improved.

When my husband and I first got our Body Align products, we started wearing our bands right away. When I was 14 I fell off a horse and cracked my tailbone and I have had problems ever since, which get worse every year. 3-4 nights a week I had to put on a heating pad just to get some rest. After several days, I realized I could sleep all night and my sciatic problems are almost gone! I don’t know how to put it into words, how miraculous it is! We are really excited.

I am using the products and getting results from the Energy Band and Relief discs. I'm an underwater photographer, and lug scuba tanks and camera equipment around all the time - I have aches and pains, being 57 years old. That's a powerful combo - a pay plan that is going bonkers generating me checks, and a no nonsense, scientifically tested product line. I'm in for the long haul on this one! Thanks Body Align Team!

"After everything I've seen & done over the years (Creating my #1 Best-Seller 'Conversations with Millionaires', being a Featured TV Success Story, & meeting many different self-made millionaires, etc), almost NOTHING I have seen or done blew me away as much as the helpful results I got from using the Body Align bracelet and stickers! You see, I had SEVERE balance and memory challenges from a Brain Anneurysm that almost killed me 5 years ago and NOTHING seemed to really help me get any better until I put the Body Align stickers and wrist band on! Right away I could FINALLY stand up from a seated position without ULTRA severe balance and head rush issues! Before using the Body Align BRILLIANCE every time I stood up from a seated position I felt like I was gonna pass out unconscious because of how SEVERE the head rush and balance issues were! My vision went pitch black and I felt like I was gonna pass out. But now, all that incredibly frustrating agony is finally GONE!! Now, from using the bracelet and stickers I can stand up from a seated (or laying) position without ANY of those harsh and dreadful issues any more!!! Thanks a MILLION for creating SUCH an amazingly powerful, brilliant, & SIMPLE solution!!"
